According to CoinMarketCap rankings, OKX consistently maintains a top-6 position for spot trading volume and ranks within the top 3 for futures trading volume. The exchange is a comprehensive trading platform supporting spot, margin, futures, options, perpetual swaps, DeFi, and more.

With over 512 cryptocurrency trading pairs available, OKX processes approximately $15 billion in daily Bitcoin futures trading volume alone. As a VASP Travel Rule compliant exchange, users can freely deposit and withdraw funds to platforms like Upbit without restrictions.

## Maximum 30% Trading Fee Rebate Details

The OKX exchange currently limits the maximum fee rebate to 30% platform-wide. This cap was implemented to prevent excessive discount ratesâ€”previous 50% rebate codes have all been adjusted down to the 30% maximum threshold.
